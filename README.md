## Description
Jonas and the Leviathan is a game based off the myth 'Jonas and the Whale'.
The story goes, that you're swallowed by a creature called a Leviathan
which caused you to be stuck in it's stomach. It's your job to escape again
by searching your way through obstacles.

This is a single player based game with an
adventurous genre to it.

The goal is to escape the Leviathan's stomach.


## Research
Engines:
- Unity (C#)

This was an assignment given in college with quite a large concept. You were supposed to create a game based off a myth, with your fellow teammates, it wasn't easy but that's what made it fun.

This project gave me a better view on project managment, setting up your tasks, teamplayer roles and more responsibilites. I enjoyed doing it, despite of it's difficulty. Eventually whenever the game finished, we were supposed to present it at an event, for companies to take a look at. Their feedback was useful for me.
